    <h1>
        Wonder Woman
    </h1>
    <p>Wonder Woman took on the role as an emissary and ambassador for Themyscira, 
        whose mission it was to bring peace to the outside world.
         In a distinct change from the methods of her male counterparts, Batman and Superman,
         Diana was willing to use deadly force when she judged it necessary.</p>
